All kata finished with **Rust**.

I wrote my **thinking** in the `README.md`, which is under the relevant kata's folder. I hope that can help or inspire you.

Each folder is a **cargo** project.

You can test your data by adding function(s) in `lib.rs,` don't forget to add `#[test]` above them.

Warning: Most of the kata were **related** to some mathematical theories. I won't **elaborate** or **prove** those theories.
